ABOUT THIS INFRASTRUCTURE:
* For every additional element, why you are adding it:
For redunduncy.
* What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works?
Round-Robin distribution Algorithm.
* Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
It is active-active, where it is connected to the clients and all the servers.
* How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works?
It uses one dtatbase as a primary and the others as replicas for redunduncy purposes.
* What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application?
A primary node is READ/WRITE whie a replica is READ only.

ISSUES WITH THIS INFRASTRUCTURE:
1- still is a single point of faliure ( the load balancer)
2- Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS, traffic is unencrypted)
3- No monitoring
